## Data-Mining

1. Read ‘Climate Change_ Earth Surface Temperature Data.zip'. it includes for CSV file

2. Merge the four tables into one table

3. View some basic information about the data frame such info, columns, shape, statistics such as mean, count, etc.

4 . Preprocess the table from missing, outlier, duplicate, etc.

5. Encode the date “dt” columns into three columns (year, month, day)

6.  Standardize or normalize the data if necessary

7. Visualize the relation between avrgtemp and tempuncerinty

8. Group data based on city, country, state

9. Visualize the temps with respect to country, city, state

10. Group data based on longitude and latitude and visualize its relation with temps

11. Add a new feature that represent the rate of change between avgtemp and uncertainty based on country

12. Compare between the temp in the different continental

13. Compare the temp in each continental

14. Group the areas (cities) around the world that have similar temps behave

15. Group the areas (cities) that have the same temp behave within date seasons
